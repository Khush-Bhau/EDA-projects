## Overview

This project analyzes a large Zomato dataset to surface business-relevant insights for restaurant operators, food delivery platforms, and analysts. The focus is on ratings, cuisines, pricing, and city-level patterns.

## Business Question

- Which cuisines and cities have the highest ratings?
- Does price correlate with rating?
- Which cuisines are over- or under-represented among top-rated restaurants?

## Dataset

- Source: `zomato.csv` (placed in the project folder)
- Main fields: `Restaurant Name`, `City`, `Cuisines`, `Average Cost for two`, `Currency`, `Aggregate rating`, `Votes`.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python: pandas, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Notebook: Jupyter

## Project Structure

```

├── Zomato.ipynb
├── zomato.csv
├── Country-Code.xlsx
├── README.md
└── images/ (optional exported plots)
```

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Standardized city and cuisine fields (split multiple cuisines into list form where needed).
- Converted price and rating columns to numeric types and handled missing/invalid values.
- Filtered low-quality entries (missing rating or zero votes) where appropriate.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Rating distribution and top cities by average rating.
- Top cuisines by frequency and by average rating.
- Price vs rating analysis and outlier inspection.

## Key Findings (summary — numeric values to be filled after running notebooks)

- Ratings skew to the upper band with X% of restaurants rated 4.0 or above.
- Top cuisines by average rating: [Cuisine A, Cuisine B, Cuisine C].
- Weak correlation between price and rating (Pearson r ≈ 0.XX).
- City hotspots: City1, City2, City3 have the highest concentrations of top-rated venues.

## How to run this project

1. Create and activate Python environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter nbconvert
```

2. Run the notebook interactively or export to HTML:

```powershell
jupyter nbconvert --to html Zomato.ipynb --output Zomato_report.html
```

## Deliverables

- Cleaned dataset (CSV) — generated by the notebook
- Notebook with EDA, charts, and observations
- Exported HTML report suitable for sharing

## Final Recommendations (high-level)

- Focus marketing on cuisine-city pairs with high ratings but low listing volume.
- Use price sensitivity analysis to identify where premium positioning pays off.
- Monitor low-vote listings for rating reliability before making strategic decisions.
